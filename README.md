# Scaling Techniques in Machine Learning Preprocessing

This repository accompanies a research project focused on analyzing the impact of various data scaling techniques on machine learning model performance.

## 📚 Overview

The study evaluates multiple preprocessing scalers (e.g., StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, RobustScaler) across a range of datasets and machine learning algorithms. The results provide insights into how different scaling methods affect accuracy, precision, recall, and model stability.
